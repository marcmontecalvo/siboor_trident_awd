axes: y,x
#    Axes on which calibration will be performed.
accel_chip_x: adxl345 EBBADXL
accel_chip_y: adxl345 EBBADXL
#    Accelerometers for vibration collection: adxl345 / mpu9250 / lis2dw,
#    etc. Are indicated for each axis on which calibration is performed.
microsteps: 32
#    Maximum microstepping displacement of the stepper motor rotor. It's
#    not necessary to increase the value above 16 with 20t pulley, these
#    fluctuations are elusive.
model: exponential
#    Model of the dependence of the displacement of microsteps on the
#    shaft of a stepper motor depends on the magnitude of the measured
#    oscillations. Supported models: linear, quadratic, cubic, power, root,
#    hyperbolic, exponential.
model_coeffs: 13881.2540203234,0.0812196402,-13522.4090229740
#    Coefficients above the described model, for calculating microsteps.
max_step_size: 16
#    The maximum number of microsteps that the motor can take move at time,
#    to achieve the planned magnitude.
retry_tolerance: 500
#    The forced threshold to which a pair of stepper motors on one belt
#    will have to lower the magnitude of the oscillations. It's recommended
#    to configure in order to filter possible inaccuracies. After several
#    iterations of starting synchronization, you will find the edge, to
#    which this parameter should be omitted.
retries: 3
#    Maximum number of repetitions to achieve a forced threshold of motor
#    synchronization deviations.
